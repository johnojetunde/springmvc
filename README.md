# Introduction

Welcome to the **Spring** module!

During this module you will learn the core concepts of the Spring Framework. <br>
Spring is by far the most widely used Java framework on the market.

Every part of the theory will be followed by the live coding session
and exercises that should be done individually, with assistance from the trainer.

Some of the key topics that are going to be explained during this module are:
- Spring Core - provides the fundamental parts of the framework (Invesion of Control, Dependency Injection, Context, Beans)
- Spring Web - contains Spring's Model-View-Controller (MVC) implementation for web applications
- Spring Security - provides Authentication, Authorization and other Security features for Web Applications or Enterprise Applications
